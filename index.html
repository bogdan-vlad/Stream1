            <p class="lead">Before taking you to my present, I want to take you on a trip to my past.</p>
            <p class="lead">It seems like it was yesterday when I was given my very first camera. A ten years old boy with a Minolta compact film camera, running around, taking pictures of everything. Literally, everything. This everything has become my love till this day.</p> 
            <p class="lead">Even though, I am a co-owner of a photography company, I do not consider myself a professional photographer, as it is a way of seeing the world, though camera lenses. It is a way of shaping the surrounding world and way of expressing myself. This is why I have decided to devote my creativity into something that I would consider as a profession.</p> 
            <p class="lead">A profession that I would be able to have space for personal development and which I would enjoy at the same time. This is why I have chosen to do coding. To be completely honest, never have I ever thought I will be able to understand all of those figures, patterns and codes. But, to be fair, I have found a beauty in coding. It is about creating, building a sphere where I can “code” my thoughts and share my vision with the world.</p>
            <p class="lead">And, in my very first coding creation, I want to show you the main differences among all types of cameras, depending on your needs or skills.
Bringing photography into my life has opened many paths for me, such as meeting plethora of inspirational people, gaining professional experience, knowledge about photography gear, professional and leisure travels. But most of all, it has taught me to enjoy the moment, as isn’t it all about? </p>
            <p class="lead">With a release of this website, I want to persuade my career into coding. I want to be one of those inspirational people who combine passion and career. As, maybe one day I can become someone’s inspiration. 
Who knows?</p>

  <p class="aboutDSLR white">A <i>digital single-lens reflex camera</i> (also called a digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera that combines the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either the viewfinder or the image sensor. </p>

    <p class="mirrorless white">A mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (MILC) is a digital camera that has a lens mount like a conventional single-lens reflex (SLR) camera, but uses a digital display system rather than an optical mirror and optical viewfinder. The name includes "mirrorless" because it does not have an optical mirror as in a conventional SLR, and "interchangeable lens" because the user can mount different lenses on the camera in order to customize the camera's optical characteristics.</p>

    <p class="bridge white">A bridge cameras are cameras that fill the niche between the single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) and the point-and-shoot camera. They are often comparable in size and weight to the smallest digital SLRs (DSLR) and there are also superzoom DSLR-shape bridge cameras with retractable lens to make it more compact, but almost all digital bridge cameras lack an optical viewfinder system (film bridges generally had a lighter version of a reflex finder).</p>
